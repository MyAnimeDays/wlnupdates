Todo:
 - Add wiki for tags, etc...

Done:
## - show how many people watching each ite,
## - special-case annoying ALLCAPS titles, lower case them.
## - unescaped https://www.wlnupdates.com/series-id/32392/
## - Narrow viewport should shrink covers
## - add links to the legal for all the inline deps - jquery, rabbitmq, etc...
## - Removing items from lists doesn't.
## - Fix all the escaped things: (Mostly "\'")

Notes:
I would like to suggest that in the list of series, you have ways of sorting the series by popularity, by rating, by editor's choice (your personal favorites), by state of completion, stuff like that.

I would also suggest that in the list of all the novels, next to the series, you have their state of completion and the last chapter translated. So it would read like "Akikan - Incomplete - Chapter 243/9000" or whatever.
