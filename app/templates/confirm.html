			You have been sent an email at the address you registered with. Please click the
			confirmation link in that email to activate your account.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that I'm currently using gmail for sending confirmation mails. The confirmation
			email will be sent from: <pre>wln0updates@gmail.com</pre> Eventually, I'd like
			to get a proper mail server setup, but using gmail was more efficent for the moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't recieve your login confirmation, please check your spam filters. Gmail has
			occasionally filtered account confirmation e-mails as spam. I have been having issues with gmail
			reporting the site as "untrusted", due to reasons I haven't been able to figure out.

		</p>
		<p>
			If you do wind up finding your confirmation mail being filtered as spam, please mark it as
			"not spam". Hopefully eventually google will figure out that a silly web/light-novel tracking
			site isn't something where trust is really even an issue. It's not like wlnupdates has any personal
			information.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you never receive a confirmation, please report the issue <a href='https://github.com/fake-name/wlnupdates/issues'>on github</a>
			so it can be fixed.
